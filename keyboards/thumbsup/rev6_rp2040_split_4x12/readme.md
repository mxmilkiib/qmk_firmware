This is a default layout for ThumbsUp! v3 5x6 (MX Version) with RP2040 soldered on the PCB.

This is a split version.
Pins are connected directly.



The configuration is copied from this project:
https://github.com/controller-works/qmk_firmware/blob/mini42/keyboards/controllerworks/mini42
Appropriate changes made to the layout/matrix, and the rgb support is removed completely, but the rest is taken competely.
I'm grateful to u/controller-works for this information.
