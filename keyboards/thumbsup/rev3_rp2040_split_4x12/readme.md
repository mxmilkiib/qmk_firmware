ThumbsUp! v3 is a low-profile split column-staggered keyboard.
The multi-level PCB design provides a feel similar to Dactyl-Manuform and Kinesis.

The configuration is copied from Mini42 by ControllerWorks:

Appropriate changes made to the layout/matrix, and the rgb support is removed completely.
I'm grateful to u/controller-works for this information.
