ThumbsUp! v7 is a low-profile split column-staggered keyboard.
The multi-level PCB design provides a feel similar to Dactyl-Manuform and Kinesis.
V7 provides interchangeable thumbcluster PCBs:
- a "classic" two-key thumbcluster 
- three variants with an extra key positioned at different places.

The configuration is copied from Mini42 by ControllerWorks:

Appropriate changes made to the layout/matrix, and the rgb support is removed completely.
I'm grateful to u/controller-works for this information.
